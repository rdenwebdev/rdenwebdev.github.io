Once I started taking lessons with Martin I became more confident. He is a perfectionist therefore will try and push you to become better, giving you the necessary feedback for you to improve. He is an awesome person and you don't feel pressured, ashamed or feel any sort of discomfort driving with him. We occasionally made a few jokes here and there to burn some steam off and always tries to make your driving schedule as comfortable as it can be. Overall I have improved massively from the first lessons with my first instructor to how I am driving now thanks to Martin. 😁 Fully recommend taking lessons with this amazing person.😁"
